Design Thinking
Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. Involving five phases‚ÄîEmpathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test‚Äîit is most useful to tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown. Although we have talked about some of these phases in the previous sections, we will now go into more detail on how it all fits together.

Design Thinking Process
The design thinking process is a five-step process that helps you to solve problems and create innovative solutions. It is a human-centered approach to problem solving that draws from the designer‚Äôs toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.
